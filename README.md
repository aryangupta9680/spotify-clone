   - Alternatively, you can open the file by double-clicking on it or using your preferred browser to view it.

This will get the project up and running on your local environment for further development or testing.


## üí° Usage

Once you have the project set up locally, here's how you can use it:

1. **Browse through playlists**: The UI displays mock playlists and albums with designs closely resembling Spotify.
2. **Control music playback**: Use the play, pause, and skip buttons in the music player interface to simulate basic music controls.
3. **Responsive experience**: Test the project on various devices to see the fully responsive design in action, from desktops to mobile screens.
4. **Customize the project**: Extend the project by adding real music data or backend integration for advanced functionality.


## üéµ Customizing Playlists  
You can easily customize or add playlists to the website. Follow these steps:  

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account.  

2. **Create a Playlist Folder**  
   In the `songs` directory, add a new folder. This folder will be recognized as a new playlist.  

3. **Add Playlist Details**  
   Include the following files in the newly created folder:  
   - `info.json`: Contains the playlist's metadata.  
   - `cover.jpg`: Serves as the thumbnail for the playlist.  

4. **Structure of `info.json`**  
   The `info.json` file should adhere to the following format:  

   ```json  
   {  
       "title": "Playlist Title",

   }  

5. Once the changes are saved, the website will dynamically load the new playlist during execution.
